# 🧬 ImmuLink  
**A Blockchain & IoT Enabled Vaccine Supply Chain Management System**

## 📌 Overview
ImmuLink is a decentralized vaccine supply chain management system designed to ensure **transparency, authenticity, and cold-chain compliance** from manufacturer to consumer.  
By integrating **Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and IoT**, ImmuLink eliminates counterfeit vaccines, prevents temperature violations, and builds trust across the healthcare ecosystem.

This system replaces opaque, manual tracking with an **immutable, real-time, verifiable digital ledger**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional vaccine supply chains suffer from:
- Counterfeit and tampered vaccines
- Lack of end-to-end traceability
- Cold-chain temperature violations
- Centralized data manipulation
- No reliable consumer feedback loop

These gaps directly impact public health and trust.

---

## 💡 Solution
ImmuLink introduces a **blockchain-backed traceability system** with:
- Smart contracts for role-based control
- IoT-based temperature monitoring
- Automated compliance checks
- Transparent consumer feedback
- Immutable audit trails

Every vaccine’s journey is tracked, verified, and validated — end to end.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
**Actors involved:**
- Manufacturer
- Trader / Distributor
- Healthcare Provider
- Consumer

**Core Components:**
- Blockchain (Ethereum-compatible)
- Smart Contracts
- IoT Sensors (Cold-chain monitoring)
- Web Dashboard (Frontend)
- MetaMask Integration

---

## 🔐 Smart Contracts
ImmuLink uses **four core smart contracts**:

1. **Manufacturer Approval Contract**
   - Registers manufacturers
   - Uses rating-based approval
   - Prevents unauthorized vaccine production

2. **Trader Registration Contract**
   - Registers distributors/traders
   - Maintains trust scores and ratings
   - Ensures accountability

3. **Cold Vaccine Monitoring Contract (IoT)**
   - Receives real-time temperature data
   - Validates cold-chain compliance
   - Flags violations automatically

4. **Consumer Feedback Contract**
   - Collects post-consumption feedback
   - Updates trust metrics
   - Enhances transparency

---

## 🌡️ IoT Integration
- Sensors continuously monitor vaccine temperature
- Data is pushed to the blockchain
- Smart contracts validate threshold compliance
- Any deviation triggers alerts and flags the batch

No silent failures. No data manipulation.
